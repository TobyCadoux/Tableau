Tableau Examples
----------------

Here are some examples of my work in Tableau.
They are best viewed in full-screen mode on a large screen as they have not (yet) been optimised for phones or small displays.
These are based on 2019 data as 2020 data is not yet available.

Teacher’s salaries as percentiles (my wife is an over-worked and under-appreciated teacher):
